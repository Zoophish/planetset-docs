# About

PlanetSet is an addon for Blender that makes the building and rendering of realistic large outdoor sets easier.

## Terrain   
PlanetSet features a procedurally tessellated [terrain system]() that allows terrain as close millimeters all the way to the horizon to be rendered on a reasonable level of hardware.

PlanetSet comes with a wide range of terrain generators and effects such as fractal noise and erosion to produce realistic landscapes. Artists may extend this using their own Geometry Node setups to produce just about any landscape they can imagine.

## Atmosphere
PlanetSet provides [two atmosphere models]() for lighting realistic outdoor scenes with large distant features like moutains and clouds.

## Clouds
PlanetSet features a cloud layer system with many preset cloud types such as Cumulus, Stratus, Cirrus and their variants.

## Oceans

!!! Warning

    **Work In Progress**

Creating an ocean is like creating another planetary surface that extends over the horizon.

The add ocean option is inside the object add menu under the planet category:

![Add Ocean](media/add_ocean.jpg){: width=50% }

You can translate the ocean plane in the z axis to adjust the sealevel.

This will add an atmosphere voume around the scene and change the scene's world background. Atmosphere Settings Air Density The sealevel density of air scattering. Higher values produce a thicker looking atmosphere. Air Exp Altitude Controls the exponential falloff of air density with altitude. At this altitude, the air density will be 36.7% of the sealevel density. Aerosol Density The sealevel density of aerosol scattering. Aerosols are particles in the air such as water or smog. Aerosol Exp Altitude Controls the exponential falloff of aerosol density with altitude. Sun Glow Controls the proportion of light that is scattered forwards by aerosols into the camera, producing a glow effect around the sun. Absorption Factor The amount of light that is absorbed by aerosols, making the distance appear darker. For a poulluted air look, this value can be made higher. Humid air on the other hand does not absorb as much light, but could have a higher density. Atmosphere Ceiling PlanetSet generates an 'atmospheric shell' around the scene when the atmosphere is enabled. This shell extends upwards into the sky until it reaches the ceiling altitude . When using the Nishita sky, the default ceiling value is 800m, which is usually enough to for a scattering/haze effect over the terrain. This value can be changed in the atmosphere panel. You may want to make this value much larger to recreate scattering for taller mountains or for high-altitude clouds. However, as the ceiling gets higher, the atmosphere starts becoming more like a true sky. Eventually, it becomes unphysical to illuminate the sky volume with the Nishita sky background. This would be equivalent to outer space looking like the sky, whereas in outer space there is just the direct light coming from the sun and everything else is black. Therefore, the physical atmopshere option simply sets the background the black and introduces a blackbody sun lamp; the colours of the sky are recreated naturally through scattering. Nishita Sky The Nishita sky model is the default sky model built into Blender which users may be familiar with. PlanetSet adds a small scale medium around the planet to add the effect of scattering and haze to the terrain and distant clouds. The light contribution comes from the background which can be thought of as an inifinitely far light source. This is not 100% correct, but produces good results in many cases. Physical Atmosphere Warning As of Blender 3.2, the physical atmosphere is currently unusable due to issues with Cycles. For this reason it is disabled, but I am working to try and get the issue resolved so it can be used again. When enabled, the background brightness is set to zero (black like outer space) and a sun disk and full-scale atmosphere is placed around the scene. The atmosphere shader mimics Rayleigh, Mie and Ozone scattering. With this setup, most of the lighting comes from actual volumetric scattering in the atmosphere, so it is very important to make sure the volume bounces are sufficient. It requires more samples to render the physical atmosphere, particularly when the sun has a low elevation. The results will look subtly different with this sky. As the artist, it is up to you to choose which you prefer, however, the physical sky is designed to be used when: You are rendering very high altitude shots (e.g. close to the edge of space) where the atmosphere's ceiling must be very high. You are rendering large, high-altitude clouds (like a storm cloud) that would benefit from lighting affected by the atmosphere at high altitude. You are rendering dusk/dawn shots - physical atmosphere recreates the Earth's shadow and The Belt of Venus .","title":"Atmosphere"},{"location":"atmosphere.html#atmosphere-settings","text":"Air Density The sealevel density of air scattering.

The cloud domain contains the cloud shader medium. It is a cylinder that follows the curvature of the planet when the radius is large enough, meaning clouds may extend over the horizon. Settings Note The domain settings are currently decoupled from the shader settings due to limitations regarding geometry nodes. Domain Radius Radius of the cylindrical cloud domain. Domain Height Height of the cylindrical cloud domain. Domain Altitude The altitude of the domain. Warning Do not translate the cloud domain in the z axis as this will cause the cloud shader to not malfunction. Control altitude using the settings. Height The overall depth of the cloud layer. Altitude The altitude of the cloud layer in the shader (should be identical to domain altitude). Radius The radius in which the cloud layer terminates completely (should match domain radius). Inner Radius The radius at which the cloud falloff begins. Density The overall scattering density of the cloud layer. Higher values yield thicker, darker looking clouds that let less light through. Coverage Controls the amount of cloud in the domain. A lower value produces smaller clouds with more spacing and vice versa for a higher value. Scale Controls how large each individual cloud is. Smaller values produce larger looking cloud features. Base Roughness Determines how smooth/turbulent the base of the clouds are. Upper Roughness Like base roughness, but for the top of the clouds. Clouds are typically rougher at the top. Sharpness Controls how abrupt the cloud edges are (which also makes the edges more dense). Wispiness Makes the clouds look smoother and less discrete when increased. Cirrus 2D High altitude strandy/wispy clouds. This cloud layer is a 2D approximation which works well at high altitudes. Settings Alttiude The altitude of the cloud plane. Density Controls the strength of the clouds. Higher values look thicker and scatter more light. Scale The overall scale of the cloud shape features. Lower values are larger and higher values are smaller. Softness Controls how abrupt the cloud edges are. Mist Volume Ground level fog/mist that exponentially decays with altitude. Fog/mist usually occurs at night, dawn or dusk. Settings Radius Radius of the cylindrical mist domain. Depth The height of the mist domain. Density The sea-level scattering desnity of the mist. Exp Altitude The altitude in which the density is 36.7% that of the sea-level density. Base Altitude The altitude that represents the zero height level for the exponential density. Since the exp altitude cannot be negative, if you would like the exp altitude to be lower than sea level, you can set the base altitude to a negative value.","title":"Clouds"},{"location":"clouds.html#clouds-panel","text":"The clouds panel is located in the atmosphere panel.

Start a new Blend file. Make sure to keep the camera, but you can delete the default cube and lamp. Create a planetary terrain by enabling planet in the PlanetSet toolbar. Press the Adjust Cycles Settings button to switch over to Cycles for rendering. To create a mountain landscape, add a Power Noise Terrain modifier from the Add Terrain Modifier menu. You will now have a basic landscape to work with. You can use the flycam mode to navigate around the scene more easily by pressing Shift + ` . When you have found an angle you are happy with, use the Align Camera to View operator, which you can find by pressing Space to bring up the operator search menu. This will reconstruct the terrain LOD relative to the view you chose: Check the camera's height (z coordinate) by selecting it and viewing the Item panel. In this example, the camera height is approximately 80m, so the projection height is set to this value. Now enable the atmosphere, by checking it in the PlanetSet panel and start the viewport renderer. The day sky is very bright, so the film exposure will need turning down by selecting the camera and going to the camera data properties: Turning down the exposure to 0.1: Now adjust the sun elevation and angle in the world properties panel so that it is facing the camera. You can also hide the floor grid and axes overlays in the viewport overlay options to declutter the viewport. Now enable clouds and add a mist volume layer via the Add Cloud Layer menu. Add a mist volume. Add a generic clouds layer. Translate the cloud layer in the xy plane by pressing G and then Shift + Z . You must not translate clouds in the z axis or it will not curve with the planet surface correctly. Adjust the cloud layer parameters to the ones in the screenshot which will produce small light cumulus clouds. Also set the sun glow to 1 and make the atmosphere ceiling 3000m. Set the base patch size to 1 to increase the terrain ridge details for the final render. It doesn't need to be much smaller as the terrain will be quite dark and details wont be visible. You can also add more clouds in the distance to fill the sky more. The settings in the screenshot above produce large cumulus clouds over the horizon. Don't forget, you can hide the cloud wireframes if they bother you by toggling the viewport overlays or you can change the viewport display to bounds. Now everything is ready to render!","title":"Misty Mountains"},{"location":"planet.html","text":"Creating a Planet Terrain The Planet Panel is used to control the planet terrain settings and to add terrain modifier presets. To create a planet set, enable the checkbox in the Planet Panel header. A new collection called 'Planet Collection' will be added to the scene, which is where all the generated planet content is placed. In the collection, a section of spherical planet surface called 'Planet' will be generated relative to the scene's active camera . Note Do not rename the collections generated by PlanetSet or move generated objects into different collections, as this will cause the references to those objects to be lost. Level of Detail (LOD) Settings Active Camera The active camera name is displayed at the top of the LOD settings. You must have an active camera in the scene for PlanetSet to generate terrain relative to. The camera in the startup scene is active by default, so you can use this. Base Patch Size This controls the size of the un-subdivided terrain quads. The smaller the value, the more detailed the terrain will be, but at the cost of performance. Tip Whilst making changes to the terrain, you may wish to keep this value relatively large to keep things running smoothly. For final quality renders, this value should be small for sufficient detail. For production quality images the base patch size can be lowered enough to produce sub-pixel detail. This is necessary for temporal stability in animations where the camera is moving. Note that sub-pixel tessellation will require a powerful computer to run smoothly. Projection Height This controls the subdivision level falloff into the distance. Inreasing the height spreads the subdivision regions out further and vice versa for decreasing it. The aim is to keep the quads approximately the same size from the viewpoint of the camera as they get further away. A good way to visualise this is to go into wireframe view and change the value: [ADD IMAGE] For views close to the ground and with a projection height of ~60m works well. For higher shots you should refer to the camera's altitude (z coordinate). For steep terrain features, you may also want to make the value higher. Altitude Bias When looking over the sea you're probably aware that the higher your altitude, the further away the horizon will appear. At a view height of 1.7m (roughly the height of a person), the distance to the horizon is about 5km. At 10m, the distance is about 11km. If the Altitude Bias property is set to 10m, then the terrain will be generated up to 11km away in all directions, since this is where the horizon will be. This is important because if the camera viewpoint is higher, the horizon will appear further away and therefore more altitude bias will be needed. Importantly, the altitude bias will generally need to be greater than the camera altitude because of terrain features that may peek over the horizon, like a mountain. A general rule of thumb is to make sure the altitude bias is at least the camera's altitude plus the height of the tallest feature in the terrain. Note the higher the value, the a larger section of planet surface will be generated, which uses more memory. Local Radius This controls the size of the area around the camera which is also subdivided. It is not related to the planet radius. This is to account for terrain features that may have a significant effect on things inside the camera view. e.g. a shadow cast by a mountain behind the camera. Planet Settings Radius This is the radius of the planet which alters the curvature of the surface. The default value is 6371,000m which is the radius of the Earth. Although the terrain may appear flat in the editor, it is actually patch of a large sphere which resultantly produces a horizon. You don't really need to change this value unless you wish to mimick different planets. Settings To access the planet settings, expand the Settings sub panel in the PlanetSet Panel. Delete Planet Deletes the entire planet collection and all objects inside. Once the planet checkbox is enabled, disabling it will only hide the planet in the viewport so that it can conveniently be hidden when needed.

PlanetSet comes with some premade geometry node modifiers that can be combined to create various types of landscapes. When you have familiarised yourself with how they work, you can make your own terrain modifiers using the User Displacement template or from scratch. Premade modifiers can be added via the Add Terrain Modifier menu. The terrain modifiers will appear in the modifier properties panel proceeding the planet modifier. Generators Generators are the starting point in terrain creation that create basic landscape features. Noise Terrain This modifier creates low frequency hilly features which is useful as a starting point for forming a landscape. It's essentially just displacement using a standard noise node. Parameters Offset Shifts the noise position along the xy plane and vertically in z (in meters). Scale Scale of the noise in the world xy plane (does not affect height). Smaller values produce larger features. Amplitude Maximum height of the noise (in meters). Note when using large amplitudes, you may wish to apply a negative z offset of half the amplitude value to bring the mid point down to sea level. Power Noise Terrain This is a slightly more complicated modulated noise pattern that creates more believable terrain features such as moutains and valleys. Parameters Scale The scale of the noise features in the xy coordinates (height not affected). Larger values produce smaller features. Distortion Controls the strength of distortion in the noise which creates a warp effect. Exponent This is the exponent part of the power noise. Increasing the value amplifies larger features relative to the smaller ones. However, it decreases the overall amplitude, so the amplitude will need increasing to compensate for this. Detail The smallest level of detail in the noise pattern. 30 should be sufficient unless the noise is very large scale, whereby you may want to increase the value. Vector The offset vector of the noise (in meters). Changes in the x and y will shift the noise features around along the planet surface. Changes in z will shift the entire terrain vertically. Tip Since Blender noise does not currently implement seeds, you can find new variations of noise by using large shifts in the x and y axes. Variance Scale Variance modulates the contribution of detail over the terrain, creating a more natural looking surface. This controls the scale of the modulation. Larger values will create more variation over a smaller amount of space and vice versa for smaller values. Variance Exponent Increasing this value makes the variance change more harshly. Radial Heightfield If you wish to bring in satellite digital elevation maps or heightmaps from other terrain generation software, you can use this modifier. It radially masks the heightmap to blend it with the surrounding terrain. Parameters Position Position of the center of the heightfield in the xy plane along the planet surface. The z component will change the overall elevation of the heightfield which can be used to align the heightmap's sealevel to the planet sealevel. Units are in meters. Radius The radius of the heightfield circle (in meters). Falloff Radius The radius, starting from the outside of the heightfield circle and going towards the center that is used for blending the terrain with surroundings. Larger values will create a longer transition. A zero value will eliminate the falloff effect and create a hard boundary. Amplitude The maximum displacement height of the heightfield (in meters). Angle Angle of rotation of the heightfield (through the z axis). Effects Effects modify existing terrain features. Erosion Fractal This adds a hydraulic erosion and deposition effect to the existing terrain. It works well over low frequency smooth terrain, but not on terrain with lots of details. The picture below is the Noise Generator example with the erosion fractal added. Parameters Scale Sets the base scale of the erosion features in the xy plane (does not affect erosion depth). If this value gets too low, it can yield unnatural looking results. Erosion Strength Controls the amplitude of the erosion effect. Directionality Controls how much the erosion pattern follows the slope of the terrain. Base Sediment Level Value between 0,1 that defines the level of sediment deposition at the base height. A higher value will raise the level of deposition at the higher points of the terrain. Upper Sediment Level Like upper sediment level, but for the base height. Usually making this value greater than the upper seiment level value will yield more nautral looking results (since sediment flows downwards). Base Sediment Height The terrain height (in meters) in which the sediment level will be equal to the base sediment level. Upper Sediment Height The terrain height (in meters) in which the sediment level will be equal to the upper sediment level. Terrace This quantizes the terrain into different strata levels. Parameters Num Levels The number of discrete altitude levels to divide the terrain into. Sharpness Controls the harshness of the jumps between the terraces. Sub Terraces The number of discrete levels in the sub-terraces, which modulate the regular terraces. Sub Terrace Sharpness The steepness of the sub terraces. From Min The lower height level of the terrain. The terrain will be terraced in region between the minimum and maximum heights. Therefore, you should ensure the min and max heights encapsulate all of your terrain. From Min The upper height level of the terrain. Miscellaneous User Displacement This is a geometry nodes template for creating your own displacements. The template works by taking the coordinate of the terrain vertices, and mapping them to a displacement value which should be between 0 and 1 so that amplitude represents the real size of the displacement in meters. In general, you will get the most control with your own node setups - the presets exist mainly as a starting point.","title":"Terrain Modifiers"},{"location":"terrain%20modifiers.html#generators","text":"Generators are the starting point in terrain creation that create basic landscape features.","title":"Generators"},{"location":"terrain%20modifiers.html#noise-terrain","text":"This modifier creates low frequency hilly features which is useful as a starting point for forming a landscape.

Scale Scale of the noise in the world xy plane (does not affect height). Smaller values produce larger features. Amplitude Maximum height of the noise (in meters).

Larger values produce smaller features. Distortion Controls the strength of distortion in the noise which creates a warp effect. Exponent This is the exponent part of the power noise. Increasing the value amplifies larger features relative to the smaller ones. However, it decreases the overall amplitude, so the amplitude will need increasing to compensate for this. Detail The smallest level of detail in the noise pattern. 30 should be sufficient unless the noise is very large scale, whereby you may want to increase the value. Vector The offset vector of the noise (in meters). Changes in the x and y will shift the noise features around along the planet surface. Changes in z will shift the entire terrain vertically. Tip Since Blender noise does not currently implement seeds, you can find new variations of noise by using large shifts in the x and y axes. Variance Scale Variance modulates the contribution of detail over the terrain, creating a more natural looking surface. This controls the scale of the modulation. Larger values will create more variation over a smaller amount of space and vice versa for smaller values. Variance Exponent Increasing this value makes the variance change more harshly.","title":"Parameters"},{"location":"terrain%20modifiers.html#radial-heightfield","text":"If you wish to bring in satellite digital elevation maps or heightmaps from other terrain generation software, you can use this modifier.
